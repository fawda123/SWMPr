The System Wide Monitoring Program ([SWMP](http://nerrs.noaa.gov/RCDefault.aspx?ID=18)) was implemented by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System ([NERRS](http://nerrs.noaa.gov/)) in 1995 to provide continuous monitoring data at over 140 continuous monitoring stations in 28 estuaries across the United States.  SWMPr (pronounced "swamper") is an R package for retrieving, organizing, and analyzing estuary monitoring data from SWMP.
